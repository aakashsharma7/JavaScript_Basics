JavaScript -> Synchronous   //It is default JS behaviour
           -> Single threaded "   "   "


Execution Context -> execute one line of code at a time
--> console.log -> 1

Blocking code --> block the flow of program --> read file sync
Non-Blocking code --> does not block Execution --> read file Async
