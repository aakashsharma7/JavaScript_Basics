> JavaScript Execution Context 

{} -> Global Execution Context
   -> Function Execution Context
   -> Eval Execution Context

> HOW TO CODE EXECUTES IN JS

{} -> Memory Creation Phase  //In this space are allocated for the declaration of var etc.
   -> Execution Phase  //In this multiply, addition, substraction, divide are in execute in this.

Example- 

let val1 = 10
let val2 = 5
Function addNum (num1, num2){
    let total = num1 + num2
    return total
}
let result1 = addNum(val1, val2)
let result2 = addNum(10, 2)

How the code runs in JS
1- Global Execution in this keyyword
2- Memory Phase -> val1 -> undefined
                -> val2 -> undefined
                -> addNum -> defined
                -> result1 -> undefined
                -> result2 -> undefined
3- Execution Phase -> val1 <- 10
                   -> val2 <- 5 
                   -> addNum -> new var environment + Execution thread --> Memory Phase          -->Execution thread   (when Execution phase is completed then it deletes automatically from there)
                                                                        ->val1 -> undefined       -> num1 ->  10
                                                                        -> val2 -> undefined      -> num2 -> 5
                                                                        -> total -> undefined     -> total -> 15
